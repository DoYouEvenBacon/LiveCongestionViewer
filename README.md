# LiveCongestionViewer
This web app is powered by the Auckland Transport API provided by NZTA (New Zealand Transport Agency) and OpenLayers API which is based on OpenStreetMaps.

Following on from my LiveBusTracker app, I built this app using the same base. I reused code for the menu, map and popups hence why it bears a similar design to by bus tracker app.

This app shows colour-coded congestion levels around the main motorways in Auckland, as well as live images of certain parts of the motorway where there are traffic cameras. It also includes a live location tracker instead of a static one because of the possible uses on the road for this app.
## Requirements
- The latest web browser. (This web app was developed in Google Chrome.)
- [An InfoConnect account provided by NZTA](https://nzta.govt.nz/traffic-and-travel-information/infoconnect-section-page/).
